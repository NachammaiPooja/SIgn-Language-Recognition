Installations to be made:

1)Anaconda 
2)Jupyter 
3)Tenserflow

Packages to be installed:

2)Create a new virtual environment using:
conda create -n sign_env python=3.7 anaconda

3)Activate environment using:
conda activate sign_env

4)Install all the required packages in the new environment using requirements.txt:
pip install -r requirements.txt

5)Launch Jupyter in the new environment

6)Execute the notebook

Execution:

1)Import all the necessary libraries given.

2)When executing the first time, dataset has to be created & the model has to be trained.

3)Here, we have included a saved pre-trained model as training with live dataset is tedious.

4)After importing execute from Step 8 in the notebook directly.
